Each sample model is provided in the following formats:
* glTF (.gltf) with separate resources: .bin (geometry, animation, skins), .glsl (shaders), and image files
* glTF (.gltf) with embedded resources
* Binary glTF (.glb) using the [KHR_binary_glTF](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/extensions/Khronos/KHR_binary_glTF/README.md) extension
* Original COLLADA (.dae)

See the `README.txt` in each model's directory for usage restrictions.
